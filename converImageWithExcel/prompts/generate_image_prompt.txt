 FINAL IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT
(Text Replacement + Design Preservation + Model Matching + Text Style Cloning)
INPUTS
You will always provide:
A product image, showing:
A person (model) wearing the product (e.g., t-shirt, hoodie, etc.)
A printed design that includes text, icons, logos, graphics
The original text on the product: [original]
The translated or replacement text to be placed instead: [translated]
OBJECTIVE
Generate a new realistic image that:
1. PRESERVES THE PRODUCT DESIGN PATTERN
Keep the original icons, graphics, logos, and general layout exactly the same
Do not alter icon position, size, or appearance
Maintain the product type (e.g., hoodie, t-shirt)
2. REPLACE TEXT EXACTLY
Locate the [original] text on the product
Replace it fully and exactly with the [translated] text, character-for-character
Do not reuse or partially show the original text
Preserve the original text’s:
Font style, weight, and family
Color and contrast
Size, letter spacing, alignment, and position on the product
Text layout (e.g., multiline, centered, arched)
The new text must appear as if it was originally printed in the exact same style, just with the new content
3. MATCH THE MODEL(S)
Match the age, gender, and number of people exactly as in the original image
For example: if the original shows an old man, generate an old man
Pose, hairstyle, facial expression, and accessories may vary
4. ALLOW CREATIVE VARIATION
Environment (indoor or outdoor) and background (blurred if needed) can change
Lighting must be natural
Seasonally inspired backgrounds allowed
Accessories such as sunglasses, watches, or jewelry may be added (max 2)
Pose and expression may vary for realism
IMAGE FORMAT
Portrait orientation with a 4:3 aspect ratio
Realistic photo style, suitable for modern e-commerce use
High quality, not cartoonish or overly artificial
STRICT NOTES
If [original] = "MIJENJAM BRACU ZA ČOKOLADU"
And [translated] = "MIJENJAM BRACU ZA ČOKOLADU 2"
The final image must show "MIJENJAM BRACU ZA ČOKOLADU 2" fully and clearly, styled exactly like the original text
